										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper">

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Painting and decorating can be a lot of fun. Whether it is a small paint job or decorating an entire house, any job can quickly look like an entire project. You knew to know what you want to do, how to do it, make the time for it, and make sure you do it right.</p>
<p>It is easy to do good at something you have done many times… but when painting and decorating without experience, it is easy to forget something.</p>
<p>So here are some reasons why you might want to consider professional painters and decorators to help you out:</p>

		</div>
	</div>
</div></div></div></div><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h3 style="color: #4c2c3d;text-align: left" class="vc_custom_heading" >1. They have a lot of experience</h3>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Painting and decorating being their job, painters and decorators know which details to keep in mind when it comes to the task. They know how to prepare walls for painting, on which bases to choose colours and finishes and how to test them. They know where to buy the best things for each requirement, so even if you are keen on buying paint and materials yourself, they have the knowledge to advice you. Operating in the area you live, also allowed them to gather experience on likely requirements like strict timeframes and aim for high customer satisfaction.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
</div></div></div></div><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h3 style="color: #4c2c3d;text-align: left" class="vc_custom_heading" >2. They are fast</h3>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Even though painting and decorating takes time, professional painters and decorators are used to working in restricted timeframes in which they do the job and clean thoroughly, so you don’t have to. While the painting and decorating goes on, you can even keep living in your own house as can be done whilst you’re at work and broken into stages. To read more about how this works, here about a <a href="https://thegoodpainter.co.uk/portfolio/painter-decorator-mayfair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">family house we decorated.</a></p>

		</div>
	</div>
</div></div></div></div><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h3 style="color: #4c2c3d;text-align: left" class="vc_custom_heading" >3. They can colour mix and are trained in painting techniques</h3>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>If you want to retouch some paint without actually painting the whole wall and you don’t know the colour, professional painters will be able to mix and blend colours until they find what you need. Painters like our offer Colour Consultation services which means selecting colours that fit your lifestyle and use paint samples under different lights and room orientation, to help find the right one. For people without experience it can be challenging to do all of this on their own and keep everything in mind.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
</div></div></div></div><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h3 style="color: #4c2c3d;text-align: left" class="vc_custom_heading" >4. They are insured</h3>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Professional painters and decorators usually have a health and safety insurance, which means you don’t have to worry about paying any bills in case of unfortunate events in your property. This can leave you at a certain peace of mind as events can happen even to the best and avoids risks for yourself. Our team of painters and decorators also provides with a 6-month warranty because we believe in taking care of our customers even after the job is completed for a 100% customer satisfaction.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
</div></div></div></div><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h3 style="color: #4c2c3d;text-align: left" class="vc_custom_heading" >5. They do all the preparation</h3>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Having selected a colour scheme for painting and decorating is the fun part. However, before that the walls and materials need to be prepared. Professional painters and decorators will prepare the walls for you, by scrapping of old paint and using sand paper to gently smoothen the surface for best application. They will use primer for the most long-lasting results and cover furniture with clean dust sheets to keep it from getting dirty and protect it from anything happening during the painting process. Usually after having helped you select the colours, painter and decorators go and provide for the materials before job begins.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
</div></div></div></div><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h3 style="color: #4c2c3d;text-align: left" class="vc_custom_heading" >6. They have accurate predictions and work within timeframes</h3>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Having plenty of experience in this field, it is easier for painters and decorators to accurately predict how much time it will take to undergo a job, what to do to fit into those timeframes and how to respond if there are unexpected events. In the case, that it is discovered that additional services will be needed, they are most likely to know where you will can these.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
</div></div></div></div><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h3 style="color: #4c2c3d;text-align: left" class="vc_custom_heading" >7. They already have the tools</h3>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Even though this may seem a very obvious reason when it comes to painting and decorating, hiring a professional painter and decorator are most likely going to save you costs as it is a safe investment as they know what they are doing, and you will not have to buy the tools if you did the job yourself. Even when buying the tools, one needs a certain amount of knowledge and especially if you expect it to be of one-job use, it is worth hiring someone.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
</div></div></div></div><div class="vc_row wpb_row vc_row-fluid"><div class="wpb_column vc_column_container vc_col-sm-12"><div class="vc_column-inner"><div class="wpb_wrapper"><h3 style="color: #4c2c3d;text-align: left" class="vc_custom_heading" >8. They will actually finish the job</h3>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>If you have ever done painting and decorating on your own, you probably know the feeling of joy slowly fading into frustration at some point at there being so much to do. The urge of quitting midway or avoiding the rush to prevent rushed results, hiring professionals is a good alternative to doings things on your own and knowing the results will be satisfying.</p>

No exception were most of our clients whether they needed to refurbish a family house or a small apartment. For most of the process, you often don’t even have to be there. Ever wondered what happens when you’re not there and how your home actually gets transformed? Here is everything that can happen in only 3 days’ time…</p>
<p>These 3 days are based on the refurbishing of an average 2 Bedroom home. We will now go into the details of the process, so even if you are not there, you are well aware of what is going on.</p>

			<p>Before starting painting and decorating, it is firstly decided on what colour will be used. Our team of painters and decorators offer Colour Consultation services and are professionally trained in the latest painting techniques. Through colour consultation we help you decide what colour you want to use, using paint samples to check a colour at different exposure of light and room orientation.</p>
<p>This is important because paint samples on the wall give a more accurate impression of what the colour will actually look like. If you simply need a freshening up of the walls by painting but you can’t remember what paint colour it is, don’t worry. Our painters and decorators can mix and blend until they find the perfect match.</p>
<p>If you are completely unsure about what colour scheme you want, our painters and decorators will help you find a palette that will go with your style and personality. There is a wide range of colours and finishes to choose from.<br />
Once agreed, the painting and decorating is ready to begin.</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>For this, before the painting and decorating begins, you can start preparing the rooms or house that you are going to have renovated.</p>
<p>Firstly, arrange access so that nothing is in the way. Furniture that is heavy or big will later on be moved by painters and decorators as part of the process. What you can do, is provide for a clean, decluttered working area and make sure that there will be access available for when the painting begins</p>

The team will early to have an early start</h3>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Our team of painters and decorators takes timeframes very seriously. We always operate within timeframes, and for that we like starting as early as possible. This is necessary because before the painting and decorating begins, there is still some preparation left to do. We believe that good preparation is the first step to satisfying and long-lasting results, which is why we put care and time into it.</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>We put value into taking care of your belongings. That is why any furniture, even if large will be moved by our painters and decorators into the middle of the room. Any furniture or of your belongings will be covered until clean dust sheets so that they are protected from any dirt or paint.</p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Before the painting and decorating begins, the walls have to be prepared. Firstly, the best supplies are bought. Then any defects in the walls need to be taken of. Some flaws like unsmooth walls or woodwork are taken away using careful sanding, to make the surfaces perfectly smooth for easy application and long-lasting results. Any cracks and holes will be filled with a substance and prepared before the painting. Before paint is applied, it is usual for a tinted primer to be used to correct any discolorations due to the filled in cracks. The colour of the substance used to unify the walls can make the paint over it have another colour than the rest of the wall. That is why tinted primer is used, so that when the walls are painted the colour is even across the wall. Another benefit of primer it will prep the walls, make the paint last longer and allow less coats of paint needed for full opacity.</p>

			<p>This is the first moment of change your home is going to live through in this process. Depending on the colour choices you have decided on previously, painters will use different techniques to start painting the walls. It is normal for the trims to be taped to prevent any uneven application and paint in places it is not supposed to be. The painters will roll and brush until the perfect colour is achieved. If it is a feature wall you are aiming for, painters will usually gently go over the ridges in the walls to make sure that when they paint, it will remain within that one wall only and keep the rest clean. Also, our painters will always keep you up-to-date throughout the process, to make sure that everything is going the way you want it to.</p>

			<p>After all the painting and decorating has been done, for the perfect finish, our painters and decorators will leave your home sparkling. We will make sure that there are no paint splashes or stains left anywhere they aren’t supposed to. The floors and any other areas will be left clean as well. Dust sheets will be removed from the furniture and taken care of, whilst the furniture will be put back into place. Lastly, after having cleaned up everything from any residues, paint or dust, the painters will ask you to look over their work and whether you are satisfied with it. This is especially important to us, as we always aim for a 100% customer satisfaction.</p>
