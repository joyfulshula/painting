			<p>It is not always easy to decide how to paint your office or workspace. Colour therapy has taught us that different shades and hues can have a remarkable effect on our mental health and wellbeing! People choose different colours and shades because they want to feel calm, energised or creative. The best colours for office painting can vary depending on the spaces you are decorating. But what are some of our favourite colours?</p>
<p>As experts in <a href="https://thegoodpainter.co.uk/office-painting-and-decorating/">office colours and in painting and decorating workspaces</a>, we have chosen the best styles we think will inspire workplaces and creative spaces across the UK.</p>

			<p>Charmed Violet is a blend we are very proud to offer our clients.  Purple is confident and inspiring, and therefore, it works brilliantly as part of any commercial painting and decorating strategy. It works best in creative spaces as well as on accent walls in general offices.  We like this colour because it is so timeless. There is a key balance between classical and contemporary here which is otherwise hard to achieve.</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>This fresh, yet warming shade is ideal for softening rooms, and painting and decorating services London and elsewhere will often choose it to complement louder, more dynamic colours. We love this shade because it works wonderfully with natural light, and off-white works perfectly with commercial spaces and general offices.  It’s an all-around choice you can genuinely rely on.</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>This white option is much cooler, but it is another of our favourite colours for a very different reason. The Strong White helps to build a contemporary, focused tone. It’s subtle and versatile, meaning that you can easily blend it with more dominant colours depending on what you require. It’s a great option for delivering inspiration without ever going too heavy.</p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>It’s long-established that colours can affect our wellbeing in a big way.  Our relationships with different shades and hues trace back centuries!  There are different colours which inspire different feelings and which can drive us to our goals.  When it comes to painting and decorating, we often find we are drawn to calming tones and dynamic shades, and these can depend on what we use our rooms for.</p>
<p>Different colours could help in office painting because of their effects on our state of mind and wellbeing.  For example, red could help to stimulate proactivity, and shades of green can bring a sense of calm.  Therefore, it can be crucial to choose paint colours carefully for the workplace!  Let’s explore this science in a little more detail with our painters and decorators’ best selections for office paint colours.</p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Red is an urgent colour!  It inspires proactivity and encourages us to be alert and to take action.  Studies show that it is a driving colour for creative spaces because it encourages us to press forward with our work.  Red can help wonderfully when physical activity is a must, and it is perfect for fast-moving offices.  Need to really spice up a productive workplace?  Red is a fantastic colour to start with.</p>

			<p>On the opposite end of the scale, blue is a very calming colour.  It inspires precision and clear thinking.  When painting and decorating an accountancy office or a management space, blue is a colour you will likely rely on.  Unlike red, shades of blue are less suited to physical jobs and more to work where you use a lot of brain power.  It’s also very easy to pair with neutral shades.  We used blue to highlight brand aesthetics and boost concentration for the Betbull team, <a href="https://thegoodpainter.co.uk/portfolio/large-office/">painting and decorating their large office at High Holborn</a>.</p>

			<p>Shades of green are used similarly to blue in office painting.  Green is a natural colour which helps to ease the mind and relieve you of stress.  It is a one of 10 best office paint colours to improve productivity, and it works beautifully with natural light.  For productive office spaces, greens can help you keep well-rested and alert for long projects.</p>

			<p>Purple is a striking, dynamic colour.  A painter and decorator will recommend purple as an accent to other shades.  However, it is perfect for stimulating productivity and creative thought.  Darker shades help to promote passion and drive.  We used purple extensively in our recent creative studio project, <a href="https://thegoodpainter.co.uk/portfolio/painting-and-decorating-studio-in-london/">painting and decorating a video game producer&#8217;s studio in Vauxhall, London</a>.</p>

			<p>Ready to renovate your space this season and want to start painting? To complete a top-quality painting job, our painters and decorators share some insight on what should and shouldn’t be done when painting and decorating. Grabbing some paint and buying brushes is all you need. Wrong. To produce a professional and clean job, we must have the correct preparation and equipment. Here are some top painting mistakes from The Good Painter that should be avoided to perform an exceptional job and renovate your residential or commercial space flawlessly.</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>It’s easy to find paint which you are fond of and want to purchase it for your room immediately. The mistake with this is, we’re not entirely aware of how it might turn out in the room. Many factors are considered, such as lighting. The colour you fell in love within that bright light room might not be a replica when painted in a room with natural lighting or not much light. Our expert team advise to find many samples and apply on the wall of your room to see what actually stands out to you and what would fit well in the space.</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Prepping is critical when wanting a smooth painting and decorating job and an uncomplicated journey. Covering floors, furniture and removing pieces will help you in the long run and can avoid headaches if the paint was to ruin your special belongings. Wrapping doorknobs and taping switch covers are just examples of easy steps to add, so everything looks clean and professional in the end. Also, cleaning the walls is something which is often forgotten but necessary to have a smooth finish. It’s not pleasant having a wall with dirt, scratches or hair particles stuck in the wall. Our painters and decorators believe cleaning your walls simply with a rag and warm water can make a significant difference to the quality of your job.</p>

			<p>You finally found a shade you like and want to go for it, however when you go to the store you’re faced with many types of paints and formulas which may be entirely new for you. You may also have to consider the surface you are working with. Has it been treated with an oil-based formula? Applying latex paint on top of it may cause the paint to peel. The Good Painter are experts regarding what the best solution is, therefore, it&#8217;s worth considering finding a painting and decorating service who can assist you. Our painters and decorators share their reasons on <a href="https://thegoodpainter.co.uk/8-reasons-why-use-professional-painters-and-decorators/">why using a professional service will be beneficial and cost-effective</a></p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Priming your walls provides a clean and quality surface to accentuate the paint and facilitate the adhesion. When painting and decorating, the first layer to apply is primer as it helps bring out the colour you desire and conceals blemishes. It is critical as it will be time and cost-effective in the long run, avoiding painting coats and coats on the wall.</p>

			<p>This may seem like an obvious point, but make sure you&#8217;re fully prepared when painting. Painting and decorating in dim or low light may seem fine at the time, but when introducing any artificial lighting or bright lights, all the mistakes, missing spots or stroke marks will be seen and fully visible. Enjoy the experience. Make sure the room is well lit with natural light, you have your favourite music on and have fun with it! The best time to schedule is early morning, where it&#8217;s the brightest part of the day where a lot of natural light will come in.</p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Painting and decorating is a lot of fun, but can get very messy… Our painters and decorators treat your home like it was our own and will take the greatest care of your furniture. We move large furniture and use clean dust sheets to cover it to keep it safe from any paint or dirt. We also take good care in keeping everything else clean like the floors in case they are textured or made of material. Lastly, after every painting and decorating job, we clean everything to leave your home sparkling and will ask you to review our work and whether you are satisfied with it. For larger properties, we also provide with professional cleaning services. Your home is in safe hands. If you want to find out more on some of the projects we did, here is one that needed extra care in handling and how we <a href="https://thegoodpainter.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tackled it</a></p>
