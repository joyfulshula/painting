			<p><span lang="EN-US">Transforming and renovating your bedroom can be a rewarding and enjoyable experience to become more positive and motivated. As we are so fond of our bedrooms and associate it to relaxation, we want to represent it in the best possible way, according to your style and comfortability.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Are you looking to transform your precious bedroom space in a short period of time? Our painters and decorators enlighten you with simple solutions to upgrade your bedroom through painting and decorating. The Good Painter dig deep in what you can do and how you can execute according to your style, taste and preference.</span></p>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Your bed is definitely the central, and more significant piece in your room, hence the name bedroom. In painting and decorating, make sure to find a position where it stays in harmony within the space. The bed should always look beautiful and inviting, so it is vital to have it proportionate to the area. Consider if your bed fits the space, is it too big for the area? If you have a larger room, does your bed sit well and not look out-of-place? A good starting tip is to consider the longest wall in the room, place your bed on this wall and position your furniture in a complementary way. This will upgrade your bedroom tremendously and allow you to create a space which makes sense.</p>

			<p>Proper bedding is essential for the high-quality sleep you deserve and the welcoming nook for a peaceful, evening read. Add comfort with throws and cushions; we love this soft <a href="https://www.amara.com/products/woven-fringed-throw-130x170cm">woven fringed throw by Amara</a>!

			<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">As a London painting and decorating company, an obvious solution would be to give your room a fresh new coat of paint, or create a beautiful statement wall in your bedroom! This is great if your room is lacking in inspiration, and you want to refocus on the colour palette and scheme. The wall behind the bed is usually the most exposed surface, relatively easy to upgrade with paint or even a beautiful wallcovering. Commence your painting and decorating a bedroom project by introducing a feature wall. It is an excellent starting point if you’re not ready for a whole renovated look or do not have sufficient materials.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">Find a colour which harmonically fits your current colour scheme or create a bold look with a contrasting paint colour. If you’re trying to achieve a space which ultimately will relieve stress and focus on relaxing, our painting and decorating team have created an entire <a href="https://thegoodpainter.co.uk/painting-and-decorating-using-colours-help-relax-and-overcome-stress/">blog post</a> on the most popular colours to achieve this goal! Another alternative is to select a beautiful wallcovering for a more romantic and gentle touch.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">Want to select the perfect wallpaper for your bedroom? Our blog post explains all from the type of wallcovering, style and colour, so make sure you read it <a href="https://thegoodpainter.co.uk/selecting-the-perfect-wallpaper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #4a6ee0;">here</span></a>. Are you looking for a spring and light wallpaper for your bedroom? Our residential painters and decorators are obsessed with this <a href="http://www.romo.com/collections/wallcoverings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #4a6ee0;">Floris Wallcovering by Romo</span></a> as it reminisces the blossoming branches of a Japanese garden!</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">Want an even simpler solution into upgrading your bedroom space? You can also introduce artwork to this wall and organise some of your favourite prints. Explore and be creative with your choices; you can fit artwork and photographs all with a relevant factor: colour, the content or subject, technique or the style. Find many limited and exclusive prints and pieces from <a href="https://www.futureicons.co.uk/">Future Icons</a>!</span></p>

			<p>Who doesn’t love finding pieces and items when decorating your residential space and home interior? Complete the look of your bedroom with elements you may not have or haven’t considered. The Good Painter are talking bedside tables, nice reading lights or even a rug to dress up your flooring. Our London decorators love this elegant and sophisticated <a href="https://shop.gubi.com/collections/table-lamps/products/multi-lite-table-lamp?variant=31264927514764">Multi-lite Table Lamp</a> for anyone trying to achieve a luxurious bedroom.</p>
<p>Make sure it is not overflooded with accessories as this may create clutter and become too busy. Overall, your bedroom is a space of comfort, so you should paint and decorate to fit the purpose. Focus on the essential things and choose pieces which will make you happy and add that unique touch!</p>

			<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #0e101a;">Creating smart and functional solutions for your bedroom will do wonders when upgrading! Painting and decorating is a significant impact, but you need to start with an organised space for it to really flourish and add another light. Identify the messier sections of your bedroom and create functional and comfortable solutions which fit your lifestyle, making sure everything has its place. Many solutions exist from jewellery racks, and cable tidies to wardrobe organisation fittings such as drawer dividers. Once this step is complete, it will truly create the perfect base when painting and decorating your bedroom, as even when painting and decorating, a messy place will continue to be messy if there isn’t a solution to fix the problem! Our residential painters and decorators believe this solution is genuinely impactful when upgrading your bedroom or any other space.</span></p>

			<p>A good clean up and organised space will be the ultimate upgrade that your residential area might be lacking. Once you have proper storage, use it! Declutter your dressing and bedside tables. Even when possessing the most stunning pieces of furniture, it won’t help create that sophisticated finished look if it is hidden under piles of books or cosmetics, for example. If you do not have much room to add side tables for decorative displays, investing in wall shelving may be the right solution for this problem, as suggested by our London painters and decorators. Another great tip, paint the wall shelving with the same colour as the wall, creating a blending illusion, and making space appear more prominent.</p>

To spruce up your home, add a fresh coat of paint on the walls, trim, or ceiling to help freshen things up &#8212; or a custom faux finish to make it unique. &#8211; <a href="https://www.stlpaintingcompany.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carter Custom Painting</a></li>
<li>Make sure to keep a wet edge when painting. Roll out the wall before your cut in dries in order to have a flawless finish. &#8211; <a href="http://www.kcneighborhoodpainting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neighborhood Painting</a></li>
<li>Make a great first impression by sprucing up your entryway. Use caulk! Clean cut lines will ensure that the first thing people see represents you and your home in the best light. &#8211; <a href="https://paintdenver.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paint Denver</a></li>
<li>Paint your kitchen cabinets to quickly give your home a fresh look. The most popular trend has been painting outdated stained wood to either a bright white or light gray. However, we’ve also been doing two-tone with bright colors on the cabinets on the island and white on the main cabinets. &#8211; <a href="https://welovepainting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jaworski Painting</a></li>
<li>Create contrast in your kitchen. For anyone that doesn’t tile the back splash areas of their kitchen and has an open wall below their cabinets and sink area, we often suggest painting that “wall” in a contrasting color to the cabinets and the rest of the kitchen. Having a contrasting wall in any room is becoming a popular style cue but sometimes it&#8217;s a bit too dramatic for some folks. By painting the limited area of your back splash and above and below your cabinets you get the same effect but it’s a bit less pronounced. &#8211; <a href="https://customcolonialpainting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Custom Colonial Painting</a></li>

			<p>To many people, grey can seem a strict and conservative colour. However, the right use of greys with different undertones when painting and decorating, can really help set the mood for a room.</p>
<p>In colour psychology it is considered the colour of compromise because it is a mix between black and grey and considered neutral. Being a very versatile colour with many undertones, it can be used to achieve almost any look: ranging from sophisticated and classic, to modern and relaxing.</p>
<p>Some people may say that in 2019, grey is in decline and will slowly disappear. Arguments say that painting your wall in grey and using black interior when decorating can make it depressing and dull. Our painters and decorators suggest that this could be to the wrong colour choices when painting and walls.</p>

			<p>Grey is a colour that comes in many different tones which all contribute to a completely different atmosphere.</p>
<p>In certain rooms, warm greys are the best option. In rooms like the bedroom, painting of the walls is recommended to do in a warmer grey, because cooler tones could lead to a cold, unpleasant environment. Grey is a relaxing, calming colour, that also acts as a stress relief. That is why a warm grey can be the perfect colour to use for painting and decorating your bedroom, to enjoy the last moments of the day.</p>
<p>For people who see grey as too dark, our painters and decorators use white paint and mix this with a grey colour, so you don’t have to use either of the two colours in their pure form.</p>
<p>Grey is a relaxing, calming colour, that also acts as a stress relief.</p>

			<p>Being a timeless colour, you can use grey to achieve almost any look.</p>
<p>You can try and paint all the walls grey or dark grey and leave the ceiling a lighter colour. This will make your walls a statement and also make the room look more spacious as the ceiling will appear taller.</p>
<p>You can also use grey as a feature wall and simply paint one wall of a room. If you feel like that is not statement enough, you could use a furniture item like a sofa or carpet in front to create the effect of colour blocking.</p>
<p>It is also a great colour when it comes to decorating it using other colours. Being a neutral colour, using some bright decorations in colours like yellow, orange or red, will really make the pops of colour stand out. You can use this to experiment and try out some colour you were thinking of decorating and painting with but didn’t want to get overwhelmed. The grey and the colours create a sense of balance and joy. Find out more on <a href="https://thegoodpainter.co.uk/painting-and-decorating-guide-to-dark-colours/">how to use bold colours when painting and decorating</a> your home from our 5 step guide.</p>
<p>If you want to achieve a modern look, you can achieve this using mostly greys and use elements of wood when decorating to follow the increasing trend of the Scandi style.</p>
<p>You can also use different textures and materials like through rugs, that will help create a sense of balance and outweigh the grey</p>

			<p>If you are a person who likes to follow trends, grey could be the perfect colour for you. As there are different colour schemes for ever year, it can be difficult and costly to try and keep up with them when painting and decorating. Grey however, is timeless, classic and modern.</p>
<p>When trying to find the perfect colour of grey, our painters and decorators recommend using paint samples in different exposures of natural and artificial light.</p>
<p>Using greys in small rooms can achieve the benefit of making them look more spacious and can easily be decorated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To try out something new, you could try the Scandi style. Find out more about <a href="https://thegoodpainter.co.uk/painting-and-decorating-using-scandi-trend-earthy-colours/">painting and decorating using Scandi trend</a>.</p>
<p>However, our painters and decorators recommend avoiding mixing too many different shades of grey as this may lead to the room looking chaotic rather than sophisticated.</p>
