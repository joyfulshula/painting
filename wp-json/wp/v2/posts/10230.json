Our London painting and decorating company are here to give your our top tips and secrets on how you can create the perfect colour scheme every time![\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;20px&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Take your time in examining the colour wheel&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%23442e3a&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]All of this is possible when you just take the simple task of bringing up your faithful and handy colour wheel and simply analysing it. It may seem far-fetched, but the colour wheel allows you to see the relationship between colours. What position of each colour lies, and what creates a harmonic balance depending on the scheme you choose to go for your home interior or London commercial interior. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sensationalcolor.com\/creating-color-harmony\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Colour harmony<\/a> allows us to see how we see colours and why the placement is not random.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;20px&#8221;][vc_column_text]For the basics of painting, we can identify the primary colours red, blue and yellow. They cannot be re-created and are considered pure colours, made to be mixed to create more tones and even further with different shades. Now we can understand and have a familiar sense with the guidance of a colour wheel, we can analyse each scheme and how to perfect a palette.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;20px&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Monochromatic Scheme&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%23442e3a&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;10236&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.housebeautiful.com\/room-decorating\/colors\/g28777092\/monochromatic-color-schemes\/?slide=12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">House Beautiful<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;10237&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/crosbystudios.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Crosby Studios<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1632129177042{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Monochromatic isn\u2019t just black and white. In fact, it is any colour you want it to be, and sticking to it. One person may find a monochromatic scheme easy and straightforward to pull off; it may also be challenging to dedicate a room with only one colour without appearing flat or dull.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;How to perfect this scheme?&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%23442e3a&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1632129203936{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]It may be one hue, but you should vary the tone shades and hints of the colour of your choice. Ensure you add a bold factor through texture or pattern. The tone of your room won\u2019t be adventurous or diverse, but the small details with materials and texture will add that visual statement and really create a solid statement with the room of your choice.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Complementary Scheme&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%23442e3a&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;10238&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.homesandgardens.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Homes and Gardens<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1632129275186{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Pull out your colour wheel and focus on a colour that really resonates with you. Now that you picked one tone look directly across the colour; this makes up a complementary scheme. Red and green, blue and orange, yellow and violet are all basic combinations of a complementary scheme. Now, we involve different shades and variations; we have an endless journey of gorgeous contrasting colours which can be used within the London interior through painting, decorating and furniture.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;How to perfect this scheme?&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%23442e3a&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1632129339277{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]For this palette, it is all about proportion and finding the correct balance. Realistically, we do not want the two colours to be equal, 50\/50, if you will. Our painting and decorating company suggest finding the primary colour you\u2019d like to use and adding the contrasting tone through furniture, accessories, or intelligent decorating. An excellent example of this would be \u00ac\u00acwhen working on our <a href=\"https:\/\/thegoodpainter.co.uk\/portfolio\/large-office\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">High Holborn office project<\/a>. Find that correct balance by gathering inspiration and looking at many complementary schemes.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Triadic Scheme&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%23442e3a&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;10239&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/form8.studio\/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Form8 Studio<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1632129406104{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]If the name isn\u2019t obvious, a triadic palette is quite a vibrant scheme as it gathers each colour to form a triangle. Think of a complementary scheme, but make it equally space by introducing a third tone to the mix. This colour scheme is playful and experimental, so it is important to know how to perfect the scheme to any space.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;How to perfect this scheme?&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%23442e3a&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1632129449141{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Again, it is all about balance and choosing colour proportions carefully. Allow one colour to dominate, while using the other two as accents. Analysing a colour wheel, you can also see what tone variation is more pleasing to your eye, and what you think is best suited for the purpose of the room. If you are looking to elevate your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thespruce.com\/triadic-color-schemes-for-bedrooms-350603\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bedroom<\/a>, here are some triadic colour schemes to do the job!
