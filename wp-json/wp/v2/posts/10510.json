A simple painted in high-quality finish can make your staircase go from 0 to 100 instantly. It is selecting a bold tone to enhance your colour palette or having a bold tone to create a striking and impactful contrast for a more daring design. The beauty of painting is the freedom of choice and expression. Analyse the colour of your choice, whether it is the extension of your current scheme or the contrast, and proceed with sampling the tones you believe will fit the most.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;20px&#8221;][vc_column_text]Our most recent blog post reviews the art of colour schemes and how you can apply it to painting and decorating in a professional way.
