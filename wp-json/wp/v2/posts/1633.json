However, many of us seem to be afraid of them when painting and decorating and often worry that they might appear depressing and unwelcoming. If you\u2019re one of \u00a0the brave ones and would like to embrace \u00a0darker colours, read our 5 top tips on how to help you make the most of your space and create a snuggly, warm environment.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Keep the ceiling light, when painting and decorating&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Leave the top of the area above wall friezes &#8211; as well as the architraves &#8211; white, or the same colour as the ceiling when painting and decorating. This will make the room look taller and less boxy, and the depth that it creates also makes the room look bigger. Keeping the ceiling light guides the eye upwards, making the ceilings look higher. You can also use lamps or chandeliers to reflect the light and give the appearance of a more open space.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;1652&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/320670435963907161\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Jazz interior up with paint colours&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]\n<p>When the walls are painted dark, it gives you a great opportunity to play on the contrast. There are so many darker colours to choose from, but one of our favourites <a href=\"https:\/\/www.farrow-ball.com\/paint-colours\/studio-green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">is Studio Green by Farrow &amp; Ball<\/a>, a deep dark green that wakes up the space and really brings interiors to life. You can decorate using light-coloured decorations and by not covering the windows to make the most out of the natural light, and using mirrors makes the room appear even more spacious. You can also use whites when painting and decorating, although take care to choose a subtle white that does not create an aggressive contrast to the dark, but rather a balance and cohesion.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;1653&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/509047564128129792\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Let it glow&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Style with metallics.

Be brave and paint all the walls dark. A statement wall might simply look insecure and could even make a small room look smaller.
