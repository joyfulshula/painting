But before you apply that first layer of the gorgeous colour that you have chosen, read through our list of 7 mistakes to avoid when painting and decorating.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Not doing paint samples before painting and decorating the room&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Choosing the colour without using samples or not using swatches\u00a0can result in the room looking very different to how you expected. Often people like a shade, whether it\u2019s bold or neutral, but don\u2019t bother testing it. \u00a0Colours look different under different lights and may end up not looking like the samples in the shop. The best idea is to buy little paint sample tins and test them on your walls first\u00a0before the\u00a0painting and decorating job begins. Choose the one that works best for your property and pick colours that complement each other if you want to use different shades for different rooms. This will make your life a lot easier when it comes to decorating.\u00a0Take a look at our\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/thegoodpainter.co.uk\/portfolio\/painter-decorator-west-london\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shepherd\u2019s Bush project<\/a>\u00a0for a few examples of sample paints.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;1657&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/340584790569544461\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Ignoring natural light and room position&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Natural light changes throughout the day and also depends on which direction your room is facing. For example, no matter how beautiful the beige\u00a0colour you have chosen,\u00a0painted in a north-facing room it would look grey and\u00a0might\u00a0have strange blue undertones. To prevent this from happening, it\u2019s a good idea to test out samples under both artificial and day light before you start painting and decorating.\u00a0The same goes for bold colours; your aim might be to achieve a dramatic look, but if the room lacks natural light it may end up looking a bit depressing.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;1658&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/327425835394565518\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Thinking that all whites are the same&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]White comes in so many shades. If you walk around Belgravia in London you\u2019ll see many different shades of white, from pinkish to greyish to yellowish and more. White is an excellent choice when you want to maximise the natural light in your space, but choose wisely when painting and decorating. Shades that are too bright can give an empty and restless feeling that seems quite clinical. Undertones can be used to make a space seem \u00a0warmer or colder and blue undertones could make a room feel depressing, so \u00a0go for more chalky options instead.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use different shades when painting and decorating depending on the room. A great example is this family\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/thegoodpainter.co.uk\/portfolio\/painter-decorator-chelsea\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">house in Chelsea<\/a> \u00a0that we\u00a0painted and decorated.

Instead, combine different shades of your favourite colour as well as different textures and materials. To avoid the room looking plain, you can also use decorations that complement the colour painted on the walls. When painting and decorating, think about using shades from a colour scheme that match but are not necessarily identical to each other to avoid making the room look monotonous.

However, painting and decorating with these colours in small spaces can be overwhelming and could leave you feeling uncomfortable and stressed instead of relaxed. It can have the effect of making rooms look even smaller and can even increase headaches due to eye strain. To avoid this, you could either limit yourself to a just a couple of colours or choose from a specific colour scheme.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;1661&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/342344009171523704\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2457&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/462533824224731926\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Ignoring other rooms and colour schemes&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Not thinking of and supporting the colours in other areas of your home, especially in open-plan spaces, can lead to chaos.
