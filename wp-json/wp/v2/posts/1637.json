They can also make a ceiling look lower too and create a more intimate environment, which is his is great \u00a0if you live in a space with very high ceilings and you feel a little bit overwhelmed.<\/p>\n<p>Apart from looking extraordinary by itself, a painted ceiling also enhances any decorations and is definitely something to consider when painting and decorating. The use of natural light gives the accessories a wonderful glow and makes them more eye-catching. To add even more emotion, try reflective d\u00e9cor on the ceiling like a chandelier or a lamp to give the room a luxurious feeling of cosiness.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;1682&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/463659724130165017\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Same colour throughout interior&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Painting walls and ceilings the same colour will give a more sophisticated look to your room. Paint the trims in white to add a little bit of contrast.<\/p>\n<p>Using the same colour can help make the most of a small room by lowering the ceilings to make the room look more extensive. You can also use a slightly lighter colour for the ceilings mixed with the colour of the walls to define high ceilings.<\/p>\n<p>Using the same colour when painting and decorating creates a feeling of coherence and unity, but at the same time provides an opportunity to create a unique contrast through decorations.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;1683&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/5840674502698207\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Show off the details&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]If you\u2019re lucky enough to have a detailed ceiling with exposed beams or grids, show it off! Use a different colour when painting and decorating to draw attention upwards and highlight all of its beautiful details. This will make the room look more personal and exciting.<\/p>\n<p>Using colour to define \u00a0patterns or details on the ceiling can create a whole new perception of the room. Darker hues can make the room appear larger as it adds dimension to the ceilings and adds focus to patterns and accessories. Adding reflective lamps as decoration can bring out of most of the also create a wonderful warm glow.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;1684&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/245094404706354146\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Budget makeover with ceiling painting and decorating&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]A painted ceiling is a cheap solution for a dull white bathroom and really adds something special.<\/p>\n<p>Try a light blue green or a soft turquoise hue to create a look of deep-sea serenity and calmness. We love this Blue Ground shade from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.farrow-ball.com\/paint-colours\/blue-ground\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Farrow &amp; Ball<\/a>, which is clean and friendly without being too cold. If there is little natural light in your bathroom, you can use lamps to make the room brighter.<\/p>\n<p>Before painting and decorating the walls, it\u2019s important to prepare them as otherwise adding colour will highlight the imperfections. As an alternative to the classic matte you can use a waterproof glossy finish, which is easier to maintain in a room that is constantly exposed to steam and water.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;1685&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/160511174204563389\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Full-on gold!&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]When painting and decorating, why not give a boring room a little bit of glamour and go for a metallic painted ceiling?
