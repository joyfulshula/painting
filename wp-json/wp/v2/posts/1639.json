We\u2019re not going to lie; there is something special and alluring about a room that\u2019s bursting with colour. With the maximalist and happy trend upon us, colours are making a massive comeback to our dream home interiors. \u00a0However, if you\u2019re no so enthusiastic about throwing buckets of paint at your beautiful mute-coloured walls, feel free to experiment with accessories like cushions, rugs, bedding and throws. Interior design can also become instantly more cheerful by incorporating a colourful piece of accent furniture or a quirky lamp shade, for example. Here\u2019s our quick 5 step guide to help you achieve the colourful look when painting and decorating.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Pops of Colour in interior&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Start with small pops of colour-a statement piece of furniture or a couple of cushions. With cushions being budget friendly, you can even colour coordinate them depending on the season to give a cosier, more homely feeling. If you get bored, you can always change them. You can also use cushions and furniture to experiment with bright colours like orange or red, and to slowly introduce more colour whilst maintaining a harmonic, balanced room. This is a good alternative and requires much less commitment than a big painting and decorating project, or painting an entire wall in a vivid colour.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;1666&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/175499716716458716\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Using colour for hallway and staircase&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Your hallway is the first thing you see when you enter your property. If you happen to have a staircase, paint the uprights in your favourite vivid colour. You can choose to keep the walls neutral to highlight the colour on the staircase, or go for a playful wallpaper to make a great first impression! <a href=\"https:\/\/www.littlegreene.com\/wallpaper\/colour\/red-wallpaper\/lavaliers-atomic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">We love this iconic 1970s pattern for creating an eye-catching entrance hall<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For a welcoming first impression, you can try to mix a few colourful, different textures &#8211; maybe \u00a0a carpet if your hallway does not have stairs.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;1667&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/274297433533374432\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Wow your guests with colours in your dining room&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Dining rooms are another excellent place to start from, since they tend to get used for special occasions. Choosing a bold colour will not overpower the space, compared to other rooms that you spend much more time in.<\/p>\n<p>If you have also chosen to also use colour in other areas, like the hallway, you can colour coordinate and use similar colours in the dining room (different shades of blue can help to create a lively yet calm atmosphere, for example). What\u2019s more, beautifully painting and decorating the dining room will most definitely wow your guests.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;1668&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/547398529704673819\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Brighten the dark interior&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Make bright colours pop with a dark backdrop.

Different coloured lamps can change the colour of the light when it shines on the darker walls and give it a softer touch. In the bedroom you could use bright-coloured covers and bedsheets, whilst in the dining room vivid cushioned chairs or paintings can add a wonderful pop of colour.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;1669&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/450993350163477871\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Block colour interiors&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Use block colours by selecting the same colour in different shades for walls, furniture and accessories when painting and decorating.
