There is no such thing as too much colour in their world and unusual colour combination are deeply loved. If you are thinking of trying out some new colours for painting and decorating here are some suggestions. Our painters and decorators work seven days a week, and through these suggestions want to express which colour combinations seem to be the best for a quirky and playful interior.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2551&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/360358407679587620\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2554&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/494551602830561310\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Yellow, Green and Blue&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]This may not seem like the obvious choice, however can be a very playful combination. Try painting the walls a light blue colour and adding elements of yellow and green when decorating. Our painters and decorators recommend this colour scheme especially in children\u2019s room as it promotes a deeper subconscious development. The blue of the walls will bring tranquillity to the room that will help sleep, deepen trust and improve communication, perfect when socialising. Yellow brings optimism and happiness and lastly, the green promotes creativity. Even though this colour combination may seem a little overwhelming, the perception of them is influenced by the intensity of the colour. In a children\u2019s room it is best to do the main colour for painting light. If you are considering of painting and decorating with this scheme in other rooms, like the living room, keep two colours muted or lighter and go bolder on what to play on the contrast.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2555&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/418271884142389560\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2556&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/80642649563857499\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Yellow, Pink and White&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Pink is a peaceful, nurturing colour and definitely not only for a girl\u2019s room. Pink is the perfect alternative for anyone who wants to do painting and decorating with red and keep elements of it but doesn\u2019t want to go too bold. Sometimes using pure red can be overwhelming and alarming. Also, using red in combination with yellow, is often seen by fast food restaurant and not exactly something you want in your peaceful living room. You can try using pink by decorating through furniture or paint the walls in a soft pink. Our painters and decorators recommend using paint samples to find the colour you want first before beginning the painting. For the colour scheme not to be too overpowering but joyful, use the white to create a sense of balance and a warm yellow to brighten up the room.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2558&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/410531322275652518\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2559&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/270145677620150664\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Orange and Grey&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Orange is a colour that depending on how it is used can have different effects on the mind. The mix of the optimism and joy of the yellow and the energy of the red, it is a happy, warm and motivating colour when used for painting. Our painters and decorators suggest using this colour with care though like using rusty oranges, as too much for it can also overpower. Try using elements of it when decorating through items like furniture or materials like pillows and rugs. The brave can try and paint one single wall orange and use a piece of orange furniture to make use of the effects of colour blocking. Use different hues of grey to balance out the bright colour. Grey is the colour of compromise, as it is a mix between black and white and promotes stability.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2560&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/299419075226690538\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2561&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/314548355209382369\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Red, white and black&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Of course, these three are classic colours and are quite often seen together. The white and the black remain timeless and red can be used as the pop of bright colour used for decorating. This colour combination is perfect for places like the kitchen. Try using glossy finishes for the red or white when painting to make the most of the reflections and make the room appear brighter. Our painters and decorators also recommend that you can use red for painting the kitchen cabinets or use red pillows if you have chairs in the kitchens.

The difference is using a shade of blue that adds tranquillity and something soothing to the room. Playing on the contrast between orange and grey can make the room look unique and bold, but if you want to tone it down a bit and make it more relaxing, our painters and decorators recommend using a blue with some kind of undertone.\u00a0 You can try and use a rusty orange and blue grey hues for painting and decorating.

If you are considering of giving your house a maritime interior, painting and decorating in blue and white is a great first step. However, they are also very versatile and can easily be introduced into any style. The blue acts as a pop of colour while the white balances it out for a neutral yet curious interior. To play on contrasts, you can try and use dark blues when painting and decorating, opposing to lighter whites.<\/p>\n<p>These colours are also great when creating a tranquil home made for socialising and relaxing.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2567&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/424675439862153238\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2568&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/149674387595001837\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Green and Purple&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]These colours lie on the sample triangle within the colour wheel, meaning the go well together. Green is a colour that brings harmony and balance to a place. It is symbolised through natural elements and nature itself and brings good luck and peace. It is also a colour that when used correctly, enhances creativity. Purple, which is considered a spiritual colour that also promotes imagination. In composition with the green, it provides the perfect environment for thinking and self-reflection. Our painters and decorators recommend colours like olive green and violet for painting and decorating.

However, when used at the right intensity and the right amounts this combination can give a room a pop of colour and make it fun without overwhelming. Our painters and decorators recommend using darker coloured blues and lighter but warm coloured pink. For example, in the living room you could use bubble-gum pink for painting the walls and do the decorating using dark blues, like by adding a midnight blue sofa. You could also try implementing a nurturing light pink in the kitchen to paint the walls and use a darker blue for tiles.<\/p>\n<p>To find out more about painting and decorating kitchens, read <a href=\"https:\/\/thegoodpainter.co.uk\/painting-and-decorating-colours-kitchen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here.<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2574&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/360358407680897444\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2575&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/360358407679496583\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Final Notes on painting and decorating for a playful interior&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Painting and decorating can be a lot of fun, and one can get easily carried away.
