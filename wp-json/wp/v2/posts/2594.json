If you decide for painting with lighter blues, you can try this in rooms with a lot of natural light to make the most of the reflected light. When decorating with light blue walls, you could try using darker colours or elements that fit in the colour scheme or simply are darker tones of blue. For example, you could try decorating with a dark blue or yellow sofa. Depending on the tone of blue, decorating can be quite easy compared to other colours, because it can act a beautiful colour combination with most colours. You could use colours like orange, white, green, pink, black and even yellow. The colour mix of white, blue and yellow can give a fresh look to the room.

Using a neutral colour schemes allows to head off into any direction you want when it comes to decorating. For sophistication, you can always add grey through decorations or use neutral colours with grey tones. However, if you change your mind about the style you want to go for and want to create a more joyful atmosphere for your guests, you can always add in pops of colour. You could try and add colourful pillows, fluffy blankets or rugs to create the to use the same colour scheme as the wall, throughout the room for a unified look, just use different textures and materials when decorating. This will give the room coherence, rather than monotony and contribute to a homely feeling.<\/p>\n<p>If you are looking for more ways to use pops of colour to brighten the room, read more <a href=\"https:\/\/thegoodpainter.co.uk\/painting-and-decorating-guide-to-dark-colours\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>\u2026[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2605&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/351773420889730619\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2606&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/488710997053894652\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Grey&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Grey is another colour that belongs to the family of classics and is very versatile. Being a timeless colour, you can use grey to achieve almost any look. To create a sense of sophistication you can try painting the walls a dark grey and allow the ceiling to stay a lighter colour. This will make the room look more spacious and unusual.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to experiment new techniques of decorating, you could paint one wall of the living room in grey and create your own feature wall. You could put a grey sofa or furniture item in front of it to break the room into geometric spaces for even more statement and make use of the effect of colour blocking. This can be original and leave your guests with an impression of your painting and decorating.<\/p>\n<p>For people who don\u2019t want to risk the living room looking too dark with grey walls, our painters and decorators recommend using lighter colours like creamy whites and add some grey to it.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to painting and decorating, grey acts similar to neutrals and is a great opportunity to try out any pops of colour you wanted to experiment with, without overwhelming the room. Try lavenders and pinks for a more serene atmosphere or rusty oranges, yellow or reds for brighter colours when decorating. The greys will balance out the colours and make the room look authentic.

Rooms like these, where there is usually a lot of socialising going on, benefit from the peace and harmony that green brings into a room. It is also a colour that comes with a lot of undertones, so if you were in consideration for the Scandi style, focused on embracing nature, earthy green colours can be a great option for you. As this style focuses on practicality and minimalism, to add pops of colour fitting in the colour scheme, you could try and get a plant for the room.
