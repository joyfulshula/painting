However, the right use of greys with different undertones when painting and decorating, can really help set the mood for a room.<\/p>\n<p>In colour psychology it is considered the colour of compromise because it is a mix between black and grey and considered neutral. Being a very versatile colour with many undertones, it can be used to achieve almost any look: ranging from sophisticated and classic, to modern and relaxing.<\/p>\n<p>Some people may say that in 2019, grey is in decline and will slowly disappear. Arguments say that painting your wall in grey and using black interior when decorating can make it depressing and dull.

In rooms like the bedroom, painting of the walls is recommended to do in a warmer grey, because cooler tones could lead to a cold, unpleasant environment. Grey is a relaxing, calming colour, that also acts as a stress relief. That is why a warm grey can be the perfect colour to use for painting and decorating your bedroom, to enjoy the last moments of the day.<\/p>\n<p>For people who see grey as too dark, our painters and decorators use white paint and mix this with a grey colour, so you don\u2019t have to use either of the two colours in their pure form.<\/p>\n<p>Grey is a relaxing, calming colour, that also acts as a stress relief.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;How to use grey when decorating&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2641&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/457537643386755333\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2642&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/95208979599015477\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]Being a timeless colour, you can use grey to achieve almost any look.<\/p>\n<p>You can try and paint all the walls grey or dark grey and leave the ceiling a lighter colour. This will make your walls a statement and also make the room look more spacious as the ceiling will appear taller.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use grey as a feature wall and simply paint one wall of a room. If you feel like that is not statement enough, you could use a furniture item like a sofa or carpet in front to create the effect of colour blocking.<\/p>\n<p>It is also a great colour when it comes to decorating it using other colours. Being a neutral colour, using some bright decorations in colours like yellow, orange or red, will really make the pops of colour stand out. You can use this to experiment and try out some colour you were thinking of decorating and painting with but didn\u2019t want to get overwhelmed.
