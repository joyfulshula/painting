It is also a great colour to use if you do not want anything too bold like white or black. It is a colour that does not go out of fashion and remains a classic for a good reason. If you are tempted to go for a grey but find that it can be a little bit dull, the bright side of grey is that it can very easily be decorated as it\u2019s a colour that can be complemented with many bold colours. Try decorating it with yellow or orange accessories for a summery look. It also a stunning colour to use if your door has any elements of glass or other material in it.

It is known that different colours and even tones influence our emotional state and feelings. Blue is one of those colours that has a vast amount of shades that can make you feel from energetic and happy, to relaxed and calm. If you want a classic blue that is bold but will look good through the long autumns and winter, try a dark blue. These colours help stand out any decorations you can have on the door as well, as for example for Christmas. If you are looking for something daring and bold, try an electric or sky blue. This will make your door a statement and unique, even before people have seen your interior.

Yellow is the colour of optimism and spreads joy. In the interior however, it can quickly before too much or be so bold that it becomes eye straining rather than relaxing. So, if you can\u2019t resist painting and decorating with yellow in your house, the front door is perfect. It will make your home stand out and make it look friendly and welcoming. At the same time, you can decorate your interior the way that suits you to relax but add a touch of your style and personality to the first impression of your home.

Orange is another colour that ranges from pastels to dark orange. If you are someone who likes to do the decorating depending on the seasons, orange can be a very versatile colour throughout the entire year. Simply decorating with a couple of accessories can make it season relevant and unique. If you are not that much into seasoning, but rather want your door decorated for it to make a statement, orange is easily complemented with many colours, like black and grey. For example, if your house walls happen to be grey, you can create a contrast by using a bright colour on the doors like orange.

Mostly in interior design painting and decorating but more and more for the outside of homes as well. They come in all sorts of different colours and almost cover the entire colour spectrum. They are a great way for painting and decorating to add colour without overpowering and to find out whether you really love a colour. Our painters and decorators recommend using colours like a muted canary yellow, fresh mint or if you are wanting to try out the Colour of the Year, try a pastel coral on your door. Even if it doesn\u2019t fit your interior design, the front door is perfect for painting in new fresh colours you always wanted to try. Another stunning effect of pastels is that it makes any patterns on your front door stand out and make it even more of a statement. However, to make those patterns look sophisticated rather than out of place, our painters and decorators recommend preparing the doors thoroughly first.<br \/>\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Final Notes on painting and decorating your front door&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Colours are a great way for self-expression and to make a statement. However, if you want to be able to say, \u201cIt\u2019s the one with the one with the coral door\u201d and make the door something that speaks for itself, it has to be groomed. Our painters and decorators recommend preparing the door thoroughly before beginning to paint. Scrape off any previous paint, sand the doors and use primers to make the finish last. Sometimes, changing the door itself can be a great way to give a whole new impression of the house and pull all the colours together for a coherent and classy look.<\/p>\n<p>If you are unsure about what colour to go for, our competent painters and decorators offer colour consultation services and are of service when it comes to the actual painting and decorating. We want to help you find your own style, express yourself through your home, and always aim for a 100% customer satisfaction.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The front door is the first thing that you get to see when you come.
