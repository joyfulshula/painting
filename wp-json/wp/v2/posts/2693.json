It is a powerful colour that can have a stunning effect on peoples\u2019 productivity, happiness and mood. There is also a lot of dispute about the colour and its impacts of the people surrounded by it, so before the painting and decorating begins, it is important to know how and where to use it. Yellow can enhance creativity and create warmth in a room, which makes the environment more comfortable and more productive. However, too much can lead to overstimulation and even eyestrain.<\/p>\n<p>It is a great colour to use in a children\u2019s room, as yellow is the first colour they see. Our painters and decorators recommend using muted but warm yellows to enhance further development of the child without overstimulating or use elements of yellow throughout the room when decorating.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to find out more on yellow, its use and what best to avoid, read more <a href=\"https:\/\/thegoodpainter.co.uk\/painting-and-decorating-with-yellow-how-and-why\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2696&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/480548222737007232\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2697&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/574771971179106580\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Green&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Simply having green around us, is proven to spark creativity. It is very versatile colour especially when it comes to painting and decorating. After many years of study, research suggests that having green around us in some form enhances visual creativity, meaning the power of imagination. People who work in environments that have green, also stimulate inventiveness.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, painting and decorating in green can have a calming and soothing effect on the mind making it a great colour for self-reflection.<\/p>\n<p>It is the colour of balance and harmony, which also makes it a great colour in rooms where there is socialising going on. That is why our painters and decorators often recommend using this colour in rooms like the living room or maybe kitchen, if you intend to spend most of your family moments in those rooms. If green isn\u2019t really a colour that fits in your colour scheme, you can try and introducing the colour by decorating and adding plants (they don\u2019t even have to be real).<\/p>\n<p>If you are considering of painting your walls green, our painters and decorators recommend greens that have earthy undertones.

Bringing the energetic aspect of red together with the optimism of yellow, it is a colour that enhances motivation and mental endurance. It is often that is seen in places where there is labour of physical strain exactly for that reason. Orange is also a bold colour that is often found in nature through flowers and fruits. Like these elements, our painters and decorators suggest that orange should be introduced into a room through decorating. When orange is at a high intensity, or simply too much of it can be alarming to be mind and cause restlessness. It is a great colour to attract attention, which is why it is often used for warning signs and why it should be used to enhance motivation, but with care.<\/p>\n<p>Our painters and decorators recommend using rusty oranges, like seen in the Scandi style, to make the most of orange and keeping it balanced.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2708&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/521080619384280131\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2700&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/753297475151688308\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Blue&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Blue happens to be a colour that promotes and deepens trust, which makes it a perfect colour for socialising It also improves communication and brainstorming skills, which makes it perfect for problem-solving. This can be integrated into an office, but if you are thinking of more personal use, you can use blue for painting and decorating within rooms like your living room or bedroom. Blue encourages a more organic thought process, harmony and balance. You can try painting one wall blue, making a feature wall and add a furniture item for decorating like a blue sofa. Make use of the effects of colour blocking to create your own creative corner.<\/p>\n<p>If you are now looking for the perfect blue, our painters and decorators recommend these:[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2709&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.farrow-ball.com\/paint-colours\/stone-blue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Farrow&amp;Ball<\/a><\/span><\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2710&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.farrow-ball.com\/paint-colours\/borrowed-light\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Farrow&amp;Ball<\/a><\/span><\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2711&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/207376757827482183\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;2712&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span class=\"TextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXO37389853 BCX0\">Image Source:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/290060032230419063\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pinterest<\/a><\/span><\/span><span class=\"EOP SCXO37389853 BCX0\">\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Red&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]This can seem like an unexpected colour choice, as red can seem alarming and distracting.<br \/>\nEspecially if a room is small, it can make it seemed heated and even uncomfortable. However, the perception of red is often depending on the intensity. Try using a muted or rusty red in a room, whether through painting or decorating to see the positive effects. Red enhances memory: making it easier to remember things that occurred and active memory. It also encourages attention to detail, making people that are surrounded by it more receptive towards messages. Our painters and decorators recommend using rusty reds or introducing red through decorating. If even those are too intense for you, our painters and decorators suggest using pink for painting and decorating.<br \/>\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Final notes on painting and decorating for a creative atmosphere&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h3|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column_text]Even though all of the colours are great and when used for painting and decorating contribute to a creative environment, using all of them will not maximise results. Mixing too many colours into one room can be overwhelming, not match and look messy. If you are unsure about which colours to go for that will also fit your personal style, our painters and decorators offer colour consultation services and also do painting and decorating.
