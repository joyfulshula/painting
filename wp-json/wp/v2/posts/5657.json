Luckily, you don\u2019t have to completely renovate a room to spruce up your home. You can give your home a whole new look by simply adding a fresh coat of paint or trying out a new, bold color.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">So whether you\u2019re on a budget or just looking for a simple way to refresh your home, a can of paint can do the trick. To spark your creativity, we asked painting experts from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.redfin.com\/city\/5155\/CO\/Denver\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Denver<\/a> all the way to those<a href=\"https:\/\/www.redfin.com\/city\/35754\/KS\/Kansas-City\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> living in Kansas City<\/a> about easy ways to spruce up your home with paint. Check out their best tips and tricks before you break out your paint brushes.\u00a0<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]\n<ol>\n<li>A little bit of paint can make all the difference. To spruce up your home, add a fresh coat of paint on the walls, trim, or ceiling to help freshen things up &#8212; or a custom faux finish to make it unique. &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stlpaintingcompany.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Carter Custom Painting<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Make sure to keep a wet edge when painting. Roll out the wall before your cut in dries in order to have a flawless finish. &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kcneighborhoodpainting.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Neighborhood Painting<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Make a great first impression by sprucing up your entryway. Use caulk! Clean cut lines will ensure that the first thing people see represents you and your home in the best light. &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/paintdenver.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paint Denver<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Paint your kitchen cabinets to quickly give your home a fresh look. The most popular trend has been painting outdated stained wood to either a bright white or light gray. However, we\u2019ve also been doing two-tone with bright colors on the cabinets on the island and white on the main cabinets. &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/welovepainting.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jaworski Painting<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Create contrast in your kitchen. For anyone that doesn\u2019t tile the back splash areas of their kitchen and has an open wall below their cabinets and sink area, we often suggest painting that \u201cwall\u201d in a contrasting color to the cabinets and the rest of the kitchen. Having a contrasting wall in any room is becoming a popular style cue but sometimes it&#8217;s a bit too dramatic for some folks. By painting the limited area of your back splash and above and below your cabinets you get the same effect but it\u2019s a bit less pronounced. &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/customcolonialpainting.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Custom Colonial Painting<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;5658&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<span lang=\"EN-US\">6. Treat your outdoor space as an extension of your home.<\/span><span lang=\"EN-US\"> Whether it&#8217;s an outdoor dining, lounging, or fire pit area, it should be like another room in your home. We love seeing concrete patios stenciled to resemble beautiful mosaic floors. &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anniewise.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wise Design<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">7. Paint the lanai\/patio area a different color than the rest of the house<\/span><span lang=\"EN-US\"> to spruce up your outdoor space. Make it fun, use vibrant colors, and create an escape right in your very own backyard! &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.burnettpainting.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Burnett Painting<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">8. Spruce up your home by reviving your deck. <\/span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Provide character and create individuality in your exterior by painting your decking and flooring with the help of stencils. Moroccan tile inspired patterns in a monochromatic or an earthy color palette is an intriguing design, especially if painted in a geometric design. &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/thegoodpainter.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"background: white;\">The Good Painter\u00a0<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">9. Create a colorful, patriotic campfire circle in your backyard.<\/span><span lang=\"EN-US\"> Purchase six Adirondack chairs and use outdoor paint to paint two of the chairs red, two of them white, and the other two blue. Display them in a circle around your new fire pit, just in time for 4th of July celebrations! &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/propainterscoloradosprings.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pro Painters Colorado Springs<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">10. If you like to change things up often, update your backyard with colors found in nature.<\/span><span lang=\"EN-US\"> It provides a clean neutral canvas to accessorize and offers great flexibility to change the look frequently. &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thepaintedviewinteriors.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Painted View\u00a0<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">11. Consider a unique accent wall. <\/span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Instead of painting an accent wall a solid bright color, add a specialty finish. You can texturize the wall in a variety of ways and design it to look marble, stripes or shapes, in any color &#8212; even metallic. &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/mcdermaidpainting.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">McDermaid Painting<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">12. Research paints that will be healthy to surround you and your family with.<\/span><span lang=\"EN-US\"> Think about what you want to represent, what feeling you want to give people, and choose a color around that. Trends will change seasonally, your values and personal brand last longer. &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eyeswide.life\/blog\/5-eco-friendly-interior-paints\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Keeper &amp; Co<\/a><\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]Originally published on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.redfin.com\/blog\/spruce-up-your-home-with-paint\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Redfin<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Good Painter collaborate with Redfin and many other experts to provide you with great tips in transforming and sprucing up your home!
