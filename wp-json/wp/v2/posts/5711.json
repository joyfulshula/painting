In painting and decorating, make sure to find a position where it stays in harmony within the space. The bed should always look beautiful and inviting, so it is vital to have it proportionate to the area. Consider if your bed fits the space, is it too big for the area? If you have a larger room, does your bed sit well and not look out-of-place? A good starting tip is to consider the longest wall in the room, place your bed on this wall and position your furniture in a complementary way. This will upgrade your bedroom tremendously and allow you to create a space which makes sense.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1591278774650{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Proper bedding is essential for the high-quality sleep you deserve and the welcoming nook for a peaceful, evening read.

This is great if your room is lacking in inspiration, and you want to refocus on the colour palette and scheme. The wall behind the bed is usually the most exposed surface, relatively easy to upgrade with paint or even a beautiful wallcovering. Commence your painting and decorating a bedroom project by introducing a feature wall. It is an excellent starting point if you\u2019re not ready for a whole renovated look or do not have sufficient materials.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Find a colour which harmonically fits your current colour scheme or create a bold look with a contrasting paint colour.

Painting and decorating is a significant impact, but you need to start with an organised space for it to really flourish and add another light. Identify the messier sections of your bedroom and create functional and comfortable solutions which fit your lifestyle, making sure everything has its place. Many solutions exist from jewellery racks, and cable tidies to wardrobe organisation fittings such as drawer dividers. Once this step is complete, it will truly create the perfect base when painting and decorating your bedroom, as even when painting and decorating, a messy place will continue to be messy if there isn\u2019t a solution to fix the problem! Our residential painters and decorators believe this solution is genuinely impactful when upgrading your bedroom or any other space.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Organise and add finishing touches&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_row_inner css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1591279124801{padding-top: 40px !important;}&#8221;][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;5727&#8243;][vc_column_text]<span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"color: #0e101a;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.carolmiluzzi.com.br\/\">Carol Miluzzi<\/a><\/span>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text]A good clean up and organised space will be the ultimate upgrade that your residential area might be lacking. Once you have proper storage, use it! Declutter your dressing and bedside tables. Even when possessing the most stunning pieces of furniture, it won\u2019t help create that sophisticated finished look if it is hidden under piles of books or cosmetics, for example. If you do not have much room to add side tables for decorative displays, investing in wall shelving may be the right solution for this problem, as suggested by our London painters and decorators. Another great tip, paint the wall shelving with the same colour as the wall, creating a blending illusion, and making space appear more prominent.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text]If you are enjoying the 5 simple solutions for any painting and decorating project in your residential setting, let us know through our platforms!<\/p>\n<p>The Good Painter is on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/the_good_painter\/\">Instagram<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/thegoodpainter.london\/\">Facebook<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/the-good-painter\/\">LinkedIn<\/a>, sharing articles and some of our favourite tips for anything painting and decorating related.
