London painting and decorating companies work closely with colour palettes as many factors are considered when choosing the perfect scheme for your home or office space. Our painters and decorators created a variety of <a href=\"https:\/\/thegoodpainter.co.uk\/painting-and-decorating-blog\/\">blog posts<\/a> in regards to selecting the correct colour scheme, tone and trends, so make sure to review the most relevant blog post to you!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"color: #0e101a;\">When choosing the right paint colours and palettes for a minimalistic interior, focus on neutral and light tones based on off-whites. You want to avoid the sterile and hospital feel as it is quite a muted scheme, that is why warmer, neutral tones are perfect for experimenting with.
