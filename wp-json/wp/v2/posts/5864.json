Our objective as a painting and decorating company is to introduce new painting tips to add that extra bit of something and elegance to your residential home. If you have trouble working with colour, yet you want to avoid the bland look, why not go half and half with a two-tone wall? Our painter and decorators think this is a simple yet strategic project which will allow an elegant and layered look, while still keeping it simple to fit the style of your home. It will feel a bit off having a bold hallway which doesn&#8217;t fit the look of your existing minimal home. <\/span><\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1594905019892{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]\n<p style=\"tab-stops: 125.25pt;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Colour ideas include pastels, neutrals or lighter spring and summer colours such as different tones of sage green, soft blues and pink blushes.

Like the two-tone effect, play with the proportions of your room using lighter and darker shades. Paint your hallways base with a lighter shade to create a more spacious environment. Take a darker colour and paint a darker wall to the far end of the hallway, where it leads to the living room or kitchen. You can create a less busy and more open environment by painting woodworks, doors or stair rails with the lighter shade. Determine the approach and outcome you\u2019d like to achieve and allow yourself to be creative with the layout of your hallway.<\/span><\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]\n<p style=\"tab-stops: 125.25pt;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Another painting trick our painters and decorators would like to share is adding accents lines or patterns and shapes to the hallway. Create intriguing looks such as painting a striper wall to the side of your entrance, or in combination with the two-tone look, define this with a straight accent line throughout.<\/span><\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Contrasting tones&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;5869&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.imperfectinteriors.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Imperfect Interiors<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;5870&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinkhouse.co.uk\/blog\/2019\/11\/27\/pink-house-helps-in-the-hallway-and-designing-stairs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pink House<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]Create a real statement and impressive hallway to your London home with experimenting colour pallets and contrasting tones.
