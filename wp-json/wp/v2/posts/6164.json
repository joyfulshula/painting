We have found many beautifully white clean, monochromatic and neutral bathrooms. Still, this article aims to enhance, to wow and create a magical little environment which will allow you to unwind. If you are starting with colour, or want to keep a fluid layout to a simplistic neutral colour scheme, and you pop of colour through accessories! Towels, storage solutions, toothbrush holders! Many bathroom accessories enable you to enhance your bathroom, even delicate and gorgeous soap dishes such as this\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amara.com\/products\/cascade-soap-dish-pink-lace\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"color: #4a6ee0;\">Cascade Pink Lace dish<\/span><\/a>\u00a0will be that small little touch and detail to upgrade your bathroom into something bolder.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Currently, we love an ombre paint effect wall with natural cool colours such as blues, greens and teals. Who doesn&#8217;t enjoy a tropical-looking bathroom, especially in a residential setting? Accentuate a holiday atmosphere and mood by imitating waves and the illusion of the sea. Not only this will add an intriguing and inviting look, but it also fits perfectly into a real relaxation environment to keep your mind calm and at ease. Blues and greens are the perfect colour for tranquillity; you can learn everything about it on our post about the variety <a href=\"https:\/\/thegoodpainter.co.uk\/painting-and-decorating-blog\/page\/3\/\">of paint colours which allows you to alleviate and stress and help you relax<\/a>!<\/span><\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;6169&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/chanandeayrs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chan + Eayrs<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]Furthermore, be experimental with your bathroom space and painting. Go beyond and further than walls by painting your ceiling! Imagine you are lying down the bathtub and you focus on a strikingly coloured ceiling. Imitate that sky effect and illusion, explore colour through other features of the bathroom. Paint doors, bathtubs, window shutters and more; embrace the architectural features of the space with monochromatic schemes.
