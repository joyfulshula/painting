Did you know that there is such a thing as healthy decorating? It\u2019s time to focus and decorate on your health. At <a href=\"https:\/\/thegoodpainter.co.uk\/\">The Good Painter<\/a>, we have a wealth of ideas and decorating tips to ensure you capitalise on that well-being interior you\u2019ve always dreamed of. Here are just a few of them you can get started with right now.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Clean Space, Clean Mind&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1599555117508{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]All painters and decorators will tell you that you need to focus on space and how you use it before breaking the paint out! Make sure you declutter your desk with smart storage solutions. A messy space is going to clutter your mind throughout the day. It\u2019s impossible to relax when you have a chaotic space that is all over the place! You could get some useful tips on our <a href=\"https:\/\/thegoodpainter.co.uk\/minimalist-painting-and-decorating\/\">\u2018how to perfect the minimalist look with painting and decorating\u2019<\/a>, there are many organisation tips there to increase your well-being!<br \/>\nConsider moving away from open storage. A well-being interior will encourage you to put items away securely when not in use. Try not to go overboard on the decoration, either. When painting and decorating, less is sometimes more![\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Create a Relaxation Zone&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;6431&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"http:\/\/www.toledano-architects.com\/\">Toledano + Architects<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1599555187252{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Don\u2019t have anywhere to head to when you want to relax? One of the best decorating tips we can offer is that you add a characterful corner or nook where you can easily unwind. Why not add an exotic touch or two? Decorating with the intent of creating a separate or magical zone, ready to unwind from daily routines and stressful lifestyles will create that distinction. This will be the perfect addition to any healthy decorating you have in place.<br \/>\nThink about light colours and gentle theming, too. London painters and decorators will help you pick the best shades and tints. If you would like to find specific shades for a soothing interior, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.housebeautiful.com\/room-decorating\/colors\/g1610\/relaxing-paint-colors\/\">House Beautiful<\/a> selects some beautiful options![\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Bring in the Plants!&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1599555216190{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Plants not only look lovely, but they can help to purify the air from room to room. You can quickly reduce stress by bringing in a variety of potted plants and shrubs to brighten up your space. A health-focused interior can make the most of plants and greenery by adding light, pleasant touches along the way.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Never Underestimate the Power of Fragrance&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]Believe it or not, smell can have a tremendous impact on healthy decorating. For example, you may wish to focus on fresh breezes through strategically placed windows. Plants, again, can help in this regard. Try and introduce essential oils and candles, too, to breed a feeling of calm.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Colour Theory&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;6432&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.yellowtrace.com.au\/television-centre-penthouse-london-waldo-works\/\">Waldo Works<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;6433&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]As a leading painting and decorating service, we of course focus on colours in all that we do. The colours you choose for your home will impact hugely on your mental and physical health alike \u2013 believe it or not. Neutral, natural colours are superb for creating instant calm. Our blog post is full of posts about the best colours to fit the purpose! You may have access to it <a href=\"https:\/\/thegoodpainter.co.uk\/painting-and-decorating-blog\/\">here<\/a>.<br \/>\nHealthy decorating with blues, greens and beiges will help you create a pleasant, balanced atmosphere, too. You don\u2019t have to stop at your walls. Choose pleasing carpet and furnishing colours alike.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Removing Features Which Drive Down Calm&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]There are, sadly, going to be a few interior design features which impact negatively on your sense of calm. Try and avoid patterns and heavy textures too much \u2013 as this could help to overwhelm your overall mood, as well as the atmosphere in your home. Heavy fabrics and textures, too, are likely to choke things up.<br \/>\nTry and choose sheer fabrics and items \u2013 it\u2019s a healthy decorating standard!<br \/>\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Want to Know More?&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]The Good Painter offers experienced painter and decorator services London homes and businesses rely on.
