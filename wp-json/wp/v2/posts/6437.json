Create an impact by introducing contrast into your environment and enhance an area which will look unique and sophisticated at the same time. Automatically, it will increase the visual interest of your home or business and create the &#8220;wow&#8221; factor you may be searching for or lacking within the existing interior. <a href=\"https:\/\/thegoodpainter.co.uk\/our-team\/\">Our painters and decorators<\/a> are here to explore the introduction to interior contrast and what elements can be worked on to complete a space with beautiful contrast and balance successfully.

Softer and more feminine interiors will focus on curved forms, soft edges and rounded elements while others will only consistently use sharp angles and strong geometric patterns and shapes. This usually is followed by different styles and design of the interior. Now, with a right balance of rounded furniture against sharp architectural detail, you find that distinct factor which will catch your eye and unconsciously make you analyse the surroundings. An interior which does this well is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dezeen.com\/2020\/08\/28\/the-wayfinder-hotel-reunion-goods-and-services-newport-rhode-island\/\">The Wayfinder Hotel by Reunion<\/a>, creating a contrast of sharp lines, furnished with rounded furniture. It also demonstrates contrast between colour, which is our next topic to explore.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Confident colour contrast&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;6441&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.seasonsincolour.com\/post\/terracotta\">Seasons in Colour<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;6442&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.neptune.com\/\">Neptune<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1601547228373{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]It is to be expected, right? The Good Painter is touching on colour again as our painters and decorators love colour palettes, schemes and every shade of existence. But this time, it truly will elevate your interior into something more. A play with colour contrast will absolutely catch the hearts of anyone looking. It mentally elevates our spirits and can create a killer interior when done correctly. You can create a complementary contrast starting with two colours, or if you feel a bit more adventurous, you may also explore a triadic scheme. Do you have your two colours in mind? Our painters and decorators suggest to keep one colour focus on walls or as a base, and the other to use as an accent and balance with furniture and accessories. This way, you create an inviting interior through painting and decorating, which doesn&#8217;t become too overbearing. If you&#8217;re someone who is a bit more minimalistic and likes a classy look, black and white works too!

The texture is that visual dimension and dynamic when it comes to the interior. As well as a touching, it stimulates the eyes due to the mixing of different surfaces, materials and pattern. Our painters and decorators believe this can be the most exciting and fun factor of contrast within the space. You can explore accessories such as curtains, cushions, throws and finishes as you decide between rough and soft, shiny or matte and smooth of fluffy. Even the smallest of accessories can accentuate the area, little details always count!
