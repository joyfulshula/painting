Duck Green is that beautifully rich but subtle tone which genuinely works well in anything. Our painters and decorators would love to see this particular shade in kitchen cabinetry to create a modern yet elegant look and aesthetic. When decorating, this tone works particularly well with warmer shades such as deep browns and bronze accents. If you are going for a green shade as your choice, this is the perfect tone for you.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Rich Red: Show Stopper&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;6871&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sherwin-williams.com\/homeowners\/color\/find-and-explore-colors\/paint-colors-by-family\/SW7588-show-stopper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sherwin Williams<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1606391491271{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Another classic shade which we love and see for Christmas, red! The shade Show Stopper by Sherwin Williams is a beautiful creamy red, which looks delicious as a statement wall within your living room, or wherever your tree is located. This colour tone will emphasise your Christmas tree and its beautiful decorations, creating the perfect contrast to your preferred traditional scheme. This red tone stands out specifically to our painters and decorators as it is slightly muted, yet creates that utmost comfort that we are all yearning for this winter season.
