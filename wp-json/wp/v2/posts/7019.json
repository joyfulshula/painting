Here are our top tips in painting and decorating your rental property and creating the perfect rental home for tenants. Let us get your London property ready for 2021.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Less is more&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;7022&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/williamsmalley.com\/work\/#jermyn-street-apartment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">William Smalley<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1608804469654{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]When painting your rental home in London, it is a common mistake that you plan it to be something which fits your taste and your perception of what will look good. Although this is allowed, you have to keep in mind not many people will appreciate the same colour scheme or fancy as you. When we approach a rental property, our initial thought is the opportunities and envisioning what you can transform it to be. Our painting and decorating company suggest keeping a neutral colour scheme and painting the walls a lighter colour. It will encourage people to rent and gives the illusion of a larger space and room, being the perfect palette to select to emphasise your purpose. Many of our clients opt for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dulux.co.uk\/en\/colour-details#tabId=item0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pure Brilliant White from Dulux<\/a>, as it is that beautiful reflective shade ideal for every interior surface.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1608804483263{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Ensure your wall and surface are ideal to complete your painting job. Our residential painting service will complete this with high-quality materials, combined with years and years of experience. We will fill any holes or cracks, sand down surfaces and ensure a high standard finish to create a spotless clean London rental home.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Step on the flooring&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;7023&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/thegoodpainter.co.uk\/portfolio\/painter-decorator-westminster\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Westminster Project<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1608804679519{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]When we review and explore flooring options, our painting and decorating company want to advise you in some choices you may want to avoid. Invest in good quality flooring! You will either find flooring high-quality but means you may need to contribute a bit more in or discover something cheaper and risk having to change it quite often for the next few years. Evaluate your rooms and consider which area will have the highest traffic, as it will inevitably suffer from wear and tear.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1608804714077{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Avoid fitting light and luxurious carpet for your rental property. Why? It will be more evident and visible of wear, and you risk extortionate bills in having them cleaned just in case of an accident. Our painting and decorating company advise going for laminated or tiled floors in spaces such as the living room, kitchen, bathroom and hallway, for example. You can invest in a high-quality laminate, which is durable and easy to clean.
