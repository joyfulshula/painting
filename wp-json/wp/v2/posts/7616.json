So, when you select that ideal tone after finding the best colour, tone and supplier, it is such a relief!<\/p>\n<p>You finally select a paint shade you absolutely adore from the catalogue, and you proceed to start painting your bedroom with it, but, something doesn\u2019t seem right. Why doesn\u2019t the colour appear like how it was presented on the catalogues, online or paint swatches? The Good Painter explains the possibilities of this displeasure and how looking beyond colour when painting and decorating is essential.<br \/>\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;How light affects colour?&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1612425517692{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Lighting is exceptionally influential when painting and decorating. Our painters and decorators explore the lighting such as natural or artificial, your room&#8217;s orientation and the amount of sunlight received. All of these predominant factors will contribute and affect your walls&#8217; colour, which is why we have the following tips to make sure the tone you choose is ideal for your personal space.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;What should you do prior?&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;7618&#8243;][vc_column_text]\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; color: #0e101a;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.farrow-ball.com\/room-inspiration\/bedroom-inspiration\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Farrow &amp; Ball<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1612425712714{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]You have compiled some of your favourite shades to purchase and start painting your home, let us reel it in for a second. The Good Painter always suggests buying paint samples before buying the 1L paint pot to commence your painting and decorating job. Purchasing a sample is much more cost-effective than buying a large can of paint which you end up disliking in the future, or it is just not how you envisioned your wall colour to be. This way, during the planning project process, you can visualise the tone in your room and if it fits the type of space you have. If you are struggling to find the ideal scheme or palette choice, Dulux provides helpful <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dulux.co.uk\/en\/expert-help\/dr-dulux-how-choose-your-paint-palette\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tips in picking the perfect palette<\/a>.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1612425778345{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Another option is finding useful phone apps which allow you to take an image of your room and choose the paint colour suggestions which will appear and display to show as an example. With advanced technology, there are many programs such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crownpaints.co.uk\/support\/myroompainter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">My RoomPainter<\/a> and others which can provide this option. But, keep in mind it is not one hundred per cent realistic, it can give you an idea of what colour you may like or dislike for your <a href=\"https:\/\/thegoodpainter.co.uk\/houses-painting-and-decorating\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">London home<\/a> and space.

If not, not to worry! This is why as a painting and decorating company, we are here to guide you and give some professional knowledge. [\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1612425833324{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]We will be exploring the following terms: North-facing room, south-facing room and east- and west-facing rooms. Here are some of the tones we recommend and why:[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;7619&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mooielight.com\/product\/mobile-chandelier-pendant-replica\/?pp=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mooie Light<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;7620&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thenordroom.com\/blog\/2019\/8\/23\/a-scandinavian-apartment-decorated-in-blue-and-grey-tones?epik=dj0yJnU9Mk9kRkFmTElpYzMwNmYzU0JrbkcteGVYVjhzYkY2bzImcD0wJm49XzZzV3VRUG5rMEtIb1g3aTVTNGZRdyZ0PUFBQUFBR0FhNHp3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Nord Room<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;North Facing Rooms&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1612426108371{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Let&#8217;s start with the most complicated. North facing rooms are quite <a href=\"https:\/\/www.architecturaldigest.com\/story\/sun-exposures-lighting-guide-tips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">limited when it comes to natural sunlight<\/a> and therefore tend to be colder and darker with little light coming through. To maximise this space&#8217;s potential, our painter and decorators recommend using warmer tones instead of the cooler shades such as blue and grey. Accentuate a cosy and warm room&#8217;s feeling and avoid a flat and dead atmosphere when using a cold shade. Ensure the tone has warmer undertones, and you will create the ideal environment for your north-facing room.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;South Facing Rooms&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1612426152883{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]We all feel blessed when painting and decorating a south-facing room as we are drained in sunlight and have the freedom to choose any tone or go for something a bit more vibrant. Enhance and take advantage of the glorious glow your room will have, finding a more daring tone and can genuinely be appreciated. If you are looking for a relaxing and tranquil environment, the combination of cooler shades such as blue and green balances the intensity and finalise and wonderfully pleasant atmosphere![\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;7621&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodelista.com\/products\/linge-particuliers-washed-linen-duvet-cover\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Remodelista<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;East and West Facing Rooms&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]Now reviewing the more inconsistent environment, west and east-facing rooms may change drastically throughout the day as the direction of sunlight moves once the day passes. To determine both rooms, east-facing spaces have more natural lighting during the morning, turning darker during the afternoon and evening. With this in mind, our painters and decorators believe cooler undertones are most suited as it harmonises and creates a relaxing aesthetic during the evening. West-facing rooms will take the opposite approach where the stronger light will be during the afternoon. Focus on using warmers tones such as neutrals and blushes; also, bold accents can work exceptionally well to complement the changes throughout the day.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]Are you interested in a professional company to renovate and apply these changes in your home? <a href=\"https:\/\/thegoodpainter.co.uk\/contact\/\">Contact<\/a> The Good Painter team today, and create the change you desire![\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It is already challenging to choose the perfect colour you want in any room of your property and space.
