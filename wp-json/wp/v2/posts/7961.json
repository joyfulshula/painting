Following this week\u2019s theme on our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/the_good_painter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram<\/a>, our painters and decorators have gathered expert tips in painting and decorating with the luxurious shade of purple! Purple is associated with many admirable characteristics. We perceive purple to be grand, mysterious, compassionate and intuitive. When utilised correctly, it can create gorgeous spaces for your residential or commercial space. Let us explore the wonderful shade of purple and how we can use it within the interior![\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Jewel Colours and Tones Scheme&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;7964&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.architecturaldigest.com\/gallery\/jamie-drake-manhattan-apartment-slideshow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Architectural Digest<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;7965&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.co.uk\/pin\/351351208428959055\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pinterest<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1614854407751{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Jewel tones such as navy blue and emerald greens create a unique environment with purple. Many looking to create a luxurious and modern space, this colour scheme has been widespread and favoured\u2014jewel and crystal toned palettes, portraying an eclectic and contemporary vibe with a hint of elegance. Create a primary base of a dusty or deep purple, add blue and emerald accents through the painting of panels trims, or use the colour from furniture and accessories. As you can see, the ideal approach is to use adjacent colours on the colour wheel. Focus on blues, greens and purple for the elegant and grand look you are trying to achieve. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.architecturaldigest.com\/gallery\/jewel-tone-interiors-slideshow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Architectural Digest<\/a> portrays an entire list of inspiration according to jewel tones, so make sure to visit for the push in motivation and inspiration.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1614854424475{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Experiment with layering dark and lighter colours, such as a darker blue with a lighter purple or rich purple with soft greens. Our painters and decorators suggest creating a visual mood board to determine what visually pleases you and which approach you are more passionate about. The final touch, add the sophisticated element of a chandelier to emphasise elegance![\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Cool Shades for Modern Look&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;7966&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/simonwhitmore.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Simon Whitmore<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;7967&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.trouva.com\/products\/broste-copenhagen-dark-grey-king-size-quilted-velvet-bedspread?utm_source=Pinterest&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;epik=dj0yJnU9MVBJdWJQaC0ybW5pdTI1bTlRSG1xRXNYZzRSVHk0WUgmcD0wJm49dmRDaDBKTzAzY3RUWnZqSXUzUTdpdyZ0PUFBQUFBR0FfejhN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trouva<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1614854749865{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]If you prefer a more minimal direction when painting and decorating an interior, we have the ideal scheme for you!

Our painters and decorators advise using off-white colours on trims, ceiling and furniture. A statement wallpaper or mural will complement this look like a charm.

Enhance and take advantage of the glorious glow your room will have, finding a more daring tone and can genuinely be appreciated. If you are looking for a relaxing and tranquil environment, the combination of cooler shades such as blue and green balances the intensity and finalise and wonderfully pleasant atmosphere![\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;7621&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.remodelista.com\/products\/linge-particuliers-washed-linen-duvet-cover\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Remodelista<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;East and West Facing Rooms&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]Now reviewing the more inconsistent environment, west and east-facing rooms may change drastically throughout the day as the direction of sunlight moves once the day passes. To determine both rooms, east-facing spaces have more natural lighting during the morning, turning darker during the afternoon and evening. With this in mind, our painters and decorators believe cooler undertones are most suited as it harmonises and creates a relaxing aesthetic during the evening. West-facing rooms will take the opposite approach where the stronger light will be during the afternoon. Focus on using warmers tones such as neutrals and blushes; also, bold accents can work exceptionally well to complement the changes throughout the day.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]Are you interested in a professional company to renovate and apply these changes in your home? <a href=\"https:\/\/thegoodpainter.co.uk\/contact\/\">Contact<\/a> The Good Painter team today, and create the change you desire![\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you looking to create a unique approach when painting and decorating your space this year?
