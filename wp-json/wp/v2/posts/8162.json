This can be applied with the wall&#8217;s full height or can be done partially depending on the look you want to achieve. Beadboard is more commonly used to create a rustic or cottage feel to your home.

This panelling style showcases horizontal, longboards that overlap each other and are positioned tightly for a weatherproof seal. Shiplap is more commonly used for the exterior of homes but proven to be very much used for homes&#8217; interior. Add a charming and unique look to your home when painting and decorating with this style of panelling.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Flat Panels &#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;8168&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1617271743703{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]If you are looking for a clean and smooth look for a dining room or living space, flat panels will complete that objective for you. Sleek for modern and contemporary designs, flat panels allow other elements in the room to shine while giving that oomph to the interior structures.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Raised Panels &#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;8169&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.onlydecolove.com\/2017\/03\/the-ikea-house.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Only Deco<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1617271867258{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]The opposite of flat panels, many opt for this look for a bolder and showy aesthetic. Raised panels consist of a series of square or rectangles separated by around 6 inches and bevels raised and elevated. Raised panels can be ideal for glamorous, traditional home spaces, or <a href=\"https:\/\/thegoodpainter.co.uk\/commercial-painters-and-decorators\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">commercial spaces<\/a> such as restaurant and hotels, for an elevated luxury experience.
