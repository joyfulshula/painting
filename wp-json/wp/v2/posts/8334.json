The actual truth of the matter is that not many of us necessarily need a lot of space, and are perfectly comfortable in smaller homes. Could painting and decorating services help us adjust easier, however?[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;20px&#8221;][vc_column_text]Why should <a href=\"https:\/\/thegoodpainter.co.uk\/apartments-painting-and-decorating\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your apartment<\/a> feel restricted or cramped? It might be time to start thinking about decorating to create a greater sense of space.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;20px&#8221;][vc_column_text]Although the size of your room may be perfectly adequate for you and your belongings, that does not mean that you will want to make the room feel more confining. In fact, if you are planning on painting and decorating a small living space, then you will definitely want to read on for some of The Good Painter&#8217;s professional tips![\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Nature is your friend!&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1620894598833{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]One of the best ways to decorate any room, including smaller spaces, is to bring nature inside. The idea is that by almost mirroring what is outside of your home, inside, there will be a natural flow into the outside world. Before you bring painters and decorators in, this can help you to make the room feel more spacious.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1620894674780{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Bringing in some <a href=\"https:\/\/woodpeckerflooring.co.uk\/us\/blog\/plants-modern-interior-design\/#:~:text=Nowadays%2C%20the%20use%20of%20plants,role%20in%20your%20overall%20health.&amp;text=Plants%20help%20reduce%20stress%20and,feel%20calmer%20and%20self%2Daligned.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">small to large house plants<\/a> is the easiest and most common way of doing this. In fact, it is a trend that has become increasingly popular over recent years due to the calming effect that plants can have in a home. To keep with the same theme, consider having natural-toned colours, such as deeper greens, yellows, reds, etc. Why not ask a London painting and decorating company for more advice?[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Mirrors create grand illusions&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;8337&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.grayoakstudio.com\/stafford-project-sitting-room\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gray Oak<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1620894767221{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]It will come as no surprise to you that possibly the most suggested tip from painters and decorators is to use mirrors to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sonomamag.com\/mirrors-make-rooms-look-bigger\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">create the illusion of largeness<\/a> in a room. Placing a mirror near a window, for example, will give the impression that it extends further into the room, and, therefore, gives the impression of it being more prominent.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1620894783923{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Another wonderful thing about mirrors is that they reflect light very well. Especially in darker rooms, having one or more mirrors will help the light to be projected more around the space. This works wonders in any small living space.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Create symmetry for balance and calm&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1620894810275{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Symmetry in any room is an excellent way of optimising space. The idea behind the symmetry within the room is that it is naturally more calming to look at, as you will see an organised space with objects and furniture that have been placed purposefully. Any painting and decorating company will say the same![\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1620894816848{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]In order to create symmetry in a small living space, you should start by creating a sort of focal point in the middle of the room. You could use a coffee table, a piece of art, a plant, etc.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1620894846408{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Then, the surrounding furniture should be placed parallel to or diagonally to one another. Remember that you are creating a balanced look, so try not to put too many objects on just one side of the room. <a href=\"https:\/\/thegoodpainter.co.uk\/residential-painting-london\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Residential decorating<\/a> is more than just splashing paint about![\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Use vertical stripes!&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;8342&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cole-and-son.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cole &amp; Son<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;8339&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1620895069554{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Experts working for professional painting and decorating services will tell you that vertical stripes are a must for small rooms. These stripes give the impression of rooms being <a href=\"https:\/\/www.urbinstorage.com\/blog\/create-space-making-ceiling-feel-taller\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">thinner and taller<\/a>.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1620895079606{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Painting and decorating your walls with stripes of either two or more colours will automatically make the ceiling in the room look like it is higher, giving the space an altogether bigger feel. The use of multiple colours as opposed to one could also help with the depth of the room.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Balance light and colour&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;8340&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1620895149187{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Choosing the right colours for your room will primarily depend on your lighting. Painting and decorating services will advise that darker rooms should not necessarily be painted in darker colours, for example.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1623586182340{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Dark colours are not the enemy, and if you decide upon a darker shade for your room, then consider the ways that you could play with the light in order for it to maintain a lighter feel. Different facing rooms will work depending on the lighting.
