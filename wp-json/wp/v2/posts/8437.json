First impressions count! However, many of us do tend to focus more on what is going on inside of our homes or workplaces. Have you ever considered exterior painting and decorating before?[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;20px&#8221;][vc_column_text]As lovely as your office may be inside, if the exterior is unmaintained, untouched, and ignored, it\u2019s hardly going to inspire people to come inside! It\u2019s not unheard of for people to hire an interior design team to spruce up the outside, too.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;20px&#8221;][vc_column_text]More and more people are considering decorating their exterior facades. Of course, designing your exterior the right way will require time, energy, and expertise! Thankfully, <a href=\"https:\/\/thegoodpainter.co.uk\/commercial-painters-and-decorators\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Good Painter<\/a> has a few ideas to help you get started &#8211; before you go ahead and splash too much exterior paint about![\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Consider your materials&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;8440&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hgtvhomebysherwinwilliams.com\/2021-color-trends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sherwin Williams<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;8441&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.littlegreene.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Little Greene<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1622701845120{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]The first thing that you will want to consider before starting any exterior painting and decorating job is getting suitable materials. No matter where you live, the weather will always affect the exterior of your home and your workplace. You need to make sure that the materials that you are planning on using outside are capable of withstanding the different circumstances that it will face. [\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1622701858306{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]It makes sense to look for specialist paint for outdoor surfaces and rough material. For example, you can invest in paint for use on metal as well as wooden posts and frames. Do also consider paint that&#8217;s going to withstand threats such a mould growth and UV.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1622701907358{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]If you\u2019re really unsure about the paint and the tools you\u2019ll need for exterior painting jobs, it pays to speak to London design professionals. A bit more on that a little further down! <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dezeen.com\/2021\/03\/06\/outdoor-dining-living-spaces-design-ideas-lookbook\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Outdoor spaces<\/a> can look fantastic with a little TLC.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Plan ahead with common sense&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%234c2c3d&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1622701930584{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]As is the case when it comes to interior design, when you are planning on undergoing an exterior makeover for your home or workplace, then you need to be prepared for how long the process is going to take. [\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1622701939176{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Your exterior painting will most likely not look perfect overnight, and in order for things to last for as long as possible outside, some groundwork will be necessary. Treating the outdoor materials before painting them, for example, is a must &#8211; and this will add to the overall time and effort taken. [\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1622701950919{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Exterior paint jobs do require different preparation and materials from job to job.
