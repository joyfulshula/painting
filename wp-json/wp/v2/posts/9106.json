Therefore, it stands to reason that you should want to reflect this in your painting and decorating, too![\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;20px&#8221;][vc_column_text]But where do you start when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/thegoodpainter.co.uk\/houses-painting-and-decorating\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">home interior design<\/a> and painting in summer? What are some of the tones and shades you are most likely to come across when the weather gets better, and the trends seem to shift?

Yes &#8211; daily life goes on &#8211; but you\u2019re always going to need somewhere calm and inspiring to return to, especially this year. Home trends for summer 2021 really bring you back down to Earth &#8211; quite literally! Consider beiges, browns, terracottas and off-whites, for example.<\/p>\n[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1627034333329{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]These shades should help to ground you at the end of a long day. A great example is available right now through the Dulux catalogue. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dulux.com.au\/colour\/colour-trends\/2021\/nourish#!\/colour\/dulux_dulux_41071\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Skip To is a lovely, deep blend<\/a> that really puts across a sense of security, calm, and contentment.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1627034344882{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]These brown and off-white blends are great summer choices for the simple fact that they take you back to nature. If you don\u2019t have any natural touches in your interior design, a really quick shortcut is to choose comforting browns and beiges.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1627034355861{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]However, it\u2019s also an excellent idea to consider embellishing your home with natural furnishings too. You should also think carefully about the shapes in your home &#8211; go for ergonomics and softness, from shape to texture and back again. Painting and decorating services can help you finalise that look![\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Clean Shades of Blue = Instant Restoration&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%23442e3a&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;9117&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.crownpaints.co.uk\/inspiration\/trends\/spring-summer-2021\/foresight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Crown Paints<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;9116&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/maguisaberian.tumblr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Magali Saberian<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1627034956554{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Summer 2021 is, again, all about retreating and reviving &#8211; it\u2019s a great season to build on your accomplishments. Blue actually remains <a href=\"https:\/\/www.idealhome.co.uk\/news\/most-popular-paint-colours-of-the-summer-on-instagram-280262\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one of the most Insta-friendly colours<\/a> ever, and there\u2019s a good reason for that.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1627034968273{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Blue is soft, summery and approachable, and palettes based in its most popular shades and hues are often surprisingly simple, too. You can pair a rich, hearty blue with a simple or warm white for that added sophistication. Neutral greys, too, can help to add to a reviving colour scheme with blue at heart.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1627034976767{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]However, you don\u2019t have to go all-blue unless you want to. Several shades of colour work wonderfully with warm accents and touches, meaning you don\u2019t have to rely on it as a standalone choice. In fact, contrasting cool blues with warm touches is an excellent idea if you want to accentuate your interior design. Blue can be contemporary or classic, but the best part is, it\u2019s always optimistic &#8211; the ideal look for summer.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Encouraging Boldness, Embracing Colour&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%23442e3a&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;9118&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.westelm.co.uk\/sphere-stem-chandelier-w2726?epik=dj0yJnU9aDI0NkVhUmtiMHR5U0hPSmxDZmFoV0hON2E1MnFQd1gmcD0wJm49T19LcG96LTJJblloZy1uZjgzTjk1QSZ0PUFBQUFBR0FWcXQ0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">West Elm<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;9119&#8243;][vc_column_text]<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sohohome.com\/products\/jeanne-armchair\/74545233?epik=dj0yJnU9NkQ2b2hLM3I2VEREeEVqSlR0WUJCM1JpVHZ4c09DRWYmcD0wJm49NXZONGo1X1FyOE1qQUFSRkVRNEhEQSZ0PUFBQUFBR0Q1cElB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Soho Home<\/a>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1627035229664{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Summer is a time when we all look forward to a change in the scenery and a change in pace. It\u2019s when things get bright and bold and when we start to look forward to drabness fade away. Some of the best home trends right now revolve around boldness through retro influence. [\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1627035239069{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Summer colours for 2021 tend to do better in pairs. It\u2019s all about celebrating diversity and create upbeat pairings that add quirk and personality to your interiors. For example, you may consider using reds with greens and with touches of blue. Red and green aren\u2019t just a pairing people associate with Christmas &#8211; it\u2019s a summer look too, when used in small ounces and in moderation.[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1627035263794{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]For more inspiration, we highly recommend the ideal palette available <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dulux.com.au\/colour\/colour-trends\/2021\/reset\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in the Dulux range right here<\/a>.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text=&#8221;Are you ready for change?&#8221; font_container=&#8221;tag:h2|text_align:left|color:%23442e3a&#8221; use_theme_fonts=&#8221;yes&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_single_image image=&#8221;9120&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1627035355080{padding-top: 20px !important;}&#8221;]Are you struggling to find the perfect look for your summer redecoration?
